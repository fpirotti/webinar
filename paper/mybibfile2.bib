abstract = {Mapping wetlands with high spatial and thematic accuracy is crucial for the management and monitoring of these important ecosystems. Wetland maps in New Brunswick (NB) have traditionally been produced by the visual interpretation of aerial photographs. In this study, we used an alternative method to produce a wetland map for southern New Brunswick, Canada, by classifying a combination of Landsat 8 OLI, ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1, and LiDAR-derived topographic metrics with the Random Forests (RF) classifier. The images were acquired in three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) with different water levels and during leaf-off/on periods. The resulting map has eleven wetland classes (open bog, shrub bog, treed bog, open fen, shrub fen, freshwater marsh, coastal marsh, shrub marsh, shrub wetland, forested wetland, and aquatic bed) plus various non-wetland classes. We achieved an overall accuracy classification of 97.67{\%}. We compared 951 in-situ validation sites to the classified image and both the 2106 and 2019 reference maps available through Service New Brunswick. Both reference maps were produced by photo-interpretation of RGB-NIR digital aerial photographs, but the 2019 NB reference also included information from LiDAR-derived surface and ecological metrics. Of these 951 sites, 94.95{\%} were correctly identified on the classified image, while only 63.30{\%} and 80.02{\%} of these sites were correctly identified on the 2016 and 2019 NB reference maps, respectively. If only the 489 wetland validation sites were considered, 96.93{\%} of the sites were correctly identified as a wetland on the classified image, while only 58.69{\%} and 62.17{\%} of the sites were correctly identified as a wetland on the 2016 and 2019 NB reference maps, respectively.},

abstract = {Abstract. The goal of this work is to assess a method for supporting decisions regarding identification of most suitable areas for two types of harvesting approaches in forestry: skyline vs. forwarder. The innovative aspect consists in simulating the choices done during the planning in forestry operations. To do so, remote sensing data from an aerial laser scanner were used to create a digital terrain model (DTM) of ground surface under vegetation cover. Features extracted from the DTM are used as input for several machine learning predictors. Features are slope, distance from nearest roadside, relative height from nearest roadside and roughness index. Training and validation is done using areas defined by experts in the study area. Results show a K value of almost 0.92 for the classifier with best results, random forest. Sensibility of each feature is assessed, showing that both distance and height difference from nearest road-side are more significant than overall DTM value.},

@article{Shimada2010,
abstract = {This paper proposes an accurate ortho-rectification and slope correction method for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a digital elevation model (DEM). Since SAR observation is performed in the squint condition, the image is distorted both geometrically and radiometrically (e.g., through foreshortening, range and azimuth shift, layover, radiometric modulation associated with slope, and shadowing). Furthermore, the pixel height cannot be retrieved directly even when orbital data are accurate. The proposed method calculates the geometric and radiometric distortion components from a comparative process between the DEM-based Simulated SAR Image (DSSI) and the SAR slant range image. When applied to Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array Type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data, the geometric accuracy of the ortho-rectified SAR image at the off-nadir angle of 34.3° was high, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.9 m when evaluated against Ground Control Points (GCPs) deployed globally. The slope correction effectively reduced the radiometric variation caused by the terrain height variation. The proposed method can be applied to a range of SAR data to support a diversity of applications. {\textcopyright} 2010, IEEE.},

abstract = {Four global mosaics of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) HH and HV polarization data were generated at 25m spatial resolution using data acquired annually from 2007 to 2010. Variability in L-band HH and HV gamma-naught ($\gamma$0) for forests was observed between regions, with this attributed to differences in forest structure and vegetation/surface moisture conditions. Region-specific backscatter thresholds were therefore applied to produce from each annual mosaic, a global map of forest and non-forest cover from which maps of forest losses and gain were generated. The overall agreement with forest/non-forest assessments using the Degree Confluence Project, the Forest Resource Assessment and Google Earth images was 85{\%}, 91{\%} and 95{\%} respectively. Using 2007 as a baseline, decreases of 0.040 and 0.028dB (with a 0.006dB 99{\%} confidence level) were observed in the HH and HV $\gamma$0 respectively over the same areas suggesting a decrease in forest area and/or increased smoothing of the global surface at the L-band radar observation over the four-year period. The maps provide a new global resource for documenting the changing extent of forests and offer opportunities for quantifying historical and future dynamics through comparison with historical (1992-1998) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR and the forthcoming (from 2014) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. Four year PALSAR mosaics and the forest/non-forest data, which were generated and analyzed in this paper, are opened to the public for free downloading albeit with coarser resolutions (WWW1). Future distribution of the higher (original) resolution datasets from PALSAR as well as the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 is planned.},

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},
