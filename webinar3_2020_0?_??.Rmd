## Agenda

- Continuation from webinar2 where Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to extract time series per each polygon of areas damaged by VAIA 
- Import extracted data in R CRAN
- Plot time series data and applying a Z-score filter over past N values to detect changes

## Before we begin

- For this Webinar we use  RStudio - if you want to follow along, make sure you have an account with GEE and have installed R + RStudio in your PC - and you have downloaded some polygons of data - I suggest to start with not more than 10-20 polygons for the excercises.
 
**Will it be recorded?** 

Slides and exercises will also be available on GitHub:

## What we will touch on

### Part 1

- Starting a repository in [GITHUB](https://github.com/) to share/sync/backup your data   
- Starting a project in R - RStudio linking to GITHUB
- Uploading to R data in GEOJson format that was exported from GEE


### Part 2

- Plotting in R
- Filtering in R


 

## R CRAN
