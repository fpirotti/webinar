## Agenda

- Load to Google Earth Engine (GEE) vegetation areas which have been subject to changes: (disturbance by fire, windthrow) 
  - In the past 5 years (Sentinel 1 data are  available since 2014) 
  - I will use areas strongly damaged by VAIA downloadable from the windthrow database   [[@Forzieri2020]](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/257/2020/) linking to an <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/A_spatially-explicit_database_of_wind_disturbances_in_European_forests_over_the_period_2000-2018/9555008" target="_blank">open database</a>  - but you can use your own scenario  
- Extract time series of Sentinel 1 backscatter data
- Import extracted data in R CRAN
- Plot time series data and applying a Z-score filter over past N values to detect changes

## Before we begin

- For this Webinar we use Google Earth Engine (GEE) and RStudio - if you want to follow along, make sure you have an account with GEE and have installed R + RStudio in your PC - and you have downloaded some polygons of data - I suggest to start with not more than 10-20 polygons for the excercises.
 
**Will it be recorded?** 

Slides and exercises will also be available on GitHub:

## What we will touch on
 

- Accessing data through GIS WFS services  
- Filtering data with QGIS to select only areas larget than 2500 m2 (Sentinel 1 has 10 m resolution, thus 5 x 5 pixels are the least number of values for a decent statistic of backscatter values in the area)
- Uploading to GEE your data
