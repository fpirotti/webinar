## Agenda

- Load to Google Earth areas which have been subject to changes in the past 5 years 
  - I will use areas strongly damaged by VAIA but you can use your own
  - The data is also downloadable from the windthrow database that was created for the paper by  [[@Forzieri2020]](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/257/2020/) linking to an <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/A_spatially-explicit_database_of_wind_disturbances_in_European_forests_over_the_period_2000-2018/9555008" target="_blank">open database</a>  containing polygons of damaged areas. 
- Extract time series of Sentinel 1 backscatter data
- Import extracted data in R CRAN
- Plot time series data and applying a Z-score filter over past N values to detect changes

## Before we begin

**Where is the webinar?** 

Seminars are open (moderated) and accessible via zoom @ https://unipd.zoom.us/j/98756930077
 

**What software should I have?** 

For this Webinar we use Google Earth Engine (GEE) and RStudio - if you want to follow along, make sure you have an account with GEE and have installed R + RStudio in your PC - and you have downloaded some polygons of data - I suggest to start with not more than 10-20 polygons for the excercises.
 
**Will it be recorded?** 

Slides and exercises will also be available on GitHub:
