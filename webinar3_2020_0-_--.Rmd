## Agenda

- Part 2 from webinar related to how Google Earth Engine (GEE) can be used to extract time series per each polygon of areas damaged by VAIA 
- Import extracted data in R CRAN
- Plot time series data and applying a Z-score filter over past N values to detect changes

## Before we begin

- For this Webinar we use  RStudio - if you want to follow along, make sure you have have installed R + RStudio in your PC   
- Make sure you have downloaded the data [download here](data/webinar3/GEEdataFromWebinar2.zip).

## Data
Data come from processing from previous webinar.  
The data is in GeoJSON format, so processing it takes a bit of extra steps as it is different from typical tabular data.
JSON data is unstructured data and very popular in the "BigDATA" era. For further reading:

- 

## R libraries

```{r message=FALSE }
library(sf)
library(mapview)
library(raster)
library(RJSONIO)
```

## Read data   
Data is zipped, but we can extract with R and then read the file.
The first line extracts the file **webinar2vaia.geojson** from the archived dataset in **GEEdataFromWebinar2.zip**...
The second line reads the GeoJSON data.
The last line shows 

```{r}
mydata<-unzip("data/webinar3/GEEdataFromWebinar2.zip")
data.gee <-    fromJSON( mydata )  
head(data.gee)
```
